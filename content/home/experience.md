  This course is intended for lower-level undergraduate students. The goal is to prepare students with the necessary knowledge and useful skills to tackle real-world data analysis challenges. This course will cover basic statistical concepts and computing skills in the field of data science. A list of the topics to be covered include:
  
  * R basics (importing data, data types, sorting and summarizing)
  * data visualization with ggplot2, robust summarises
  * intro to probability, statistical inference, regression models
  * intro to machine learning (classification, clustering, and prediction).
