  This is a course in mathematical statistics intended for upper-level undergraduate students
  in the mathematical sciences as well as for graduate students in all disciplines. The goal is
  to provide a solid foundation in th theory of random variables and probability distributions.
  
  * Probability and distributions (sets, random variables, expectation, important inequalities)
  * Multivariate distributions (joint/marginal distributions, transformation, independence)
  * Some special distributions (Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Normal)
