I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology with a BSc in Biology in 2013, and obtained MS in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan in 2016. My dissertation work focuses on developing real-time regression methods for both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, advised by <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~songlab/people.html" target="_blank">Professor Peter X.K. Song</a>. I am also working as a graduate student research assistant (GSRA) on Black Womenâ€™s Wellness Project.
