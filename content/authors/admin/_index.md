I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa. I did my PhD in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, working with <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~songlab/people.html" target="_blank">Professor Peter X.K. Song</a>. My research interests lie at developing real-time analytics to address methodological needs in the analysis of streaming data such as periodically updated large-scale database and mobile health data. In particular, I am interested in developing online analytic toolboxes in regression models with a main focus on statistical inference. Some specific topics I am currently working on include online high-dimensional regression and post-selection inference, addressing dynamic heterogeneity and inter-data batch correlation in streaming data, and online semi-parametric regression.
