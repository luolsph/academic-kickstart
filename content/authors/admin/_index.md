I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Rutgers University. My research focuses on developing real-time analytics to meet the methodological requirements associated with the analysis of streaming data. These include large-scale databases that are periodically updated and mobile health data. In particular, I am interested in developing online analysis toolboxes with a main focus on statistical inference. In addition to these areas, my research pursuits encompass adaptive experimental design, longitudinal mediation analysis, and epigenetic clocks.
