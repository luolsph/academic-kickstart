I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://stat.uiowa.edu" target="_blank">Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at University of Iowa. I did my PhD in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, working with <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~songlab/people.html" target="_blank">Professor Peter X.K. Song</a>. My research interests lie at developing real-time analytics to address methodological needs in the analysis of streaming data such as mobile health data. My dissertation work focuses on developing real-time regression methods for both cross-sectional and cluster-correlated data streams under homogeneity assumption, as well as data streams with dynamically evolved batch-specific effects in state space mixed models.
